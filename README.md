# SofAR Obstacle detection project 

### Team
* Luigi Secondo
* Ruslan Aminev

### Plan draft

1. Find datasets
2. Evaluate datasets, select feasible one
3. Choose detection algorithm (DNN architecture)
4. Prepare labels according to chosen algorithm
5. Evaluate the perfomance of the algorithm
6. Integrate algorithm in ROS
7. Apply algorithm to real robot (Husqvarna)

### Possible enhancements

* Combine several datasets in one
